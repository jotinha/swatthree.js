		<p>This is an experimental WebGL map viewer for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT_3:_Close_Quarters_Battle">SWAT3</a> scn files. Built on top of <a href="http://threejs.org">three.js</a> and one or two sleepless nights.  </p>
  
		<p>	The scn file spec was never released, and I'd be very suprised if it ever was,
		   but with a bit of patience and free time it's been almost fully reverse engineered. <p>See on github.</p>
		</p>

		<p> I don't know who holds the rights to the SWAT franchise. Last time I checked it was in corporate limbo. Nevertheless, the SWAT3 brand and all the artwork on this page belong to their rightful owners. This is for demonstration purposes only.
